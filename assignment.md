# Car Rental System Assignment

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for developing a car rental system where users can register, log in, browse available cars, and rent them. The system will have two main user roles: Customer and Admin, with different permissions and capabilities.

## System Requirements

   - Select rental dates (start and end)
   - Calculate total price based on number of days
   - Confirm rental details
   - Process payment (mock implementation is acceptable)
   - Generate rental confirmation

2. **Rental Management**
   - View active rentals
   - View rental history
   - Cancel upcoming rentals (if permitted)
   - Extend current rentals (if car is available for extension period)

3. **Admin Rental Overview**
   - View all current and past rentals
   - Filter rentals by user, car, date, status
   - Generate reports (optional)

   - Proper entity relationships
   - Database migration strategy

3. **Security**
   - Spring Security implementation
   - JWT authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Protection against common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection)

### Frontend
